# CCL
Computer Control Language. Finally, you can control your computer!

## Description

CCL is a interpreted language written in C++. Some features include:

 * A simple and consistent syntax model, perfect for fast execution.
 * An expressive and powerful function library.
 * An intuitive yet innovative execution model.

## Downloads

Get the CCL introduction slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QwefIA8YP4kgyg5VEnUOz_pjGxFsNeCmqHEhd5dw8CQ/edit?usp=sharing)!

The drone.io build server can be found [here](https://drone.io/github.com/iconmaster5326/CCL/files).

It has the latest executable available for download.

## Compiling

This project's Makefile was created by NetBeans for a Cygwin environment. I have no clue if it works anywhere else.

## Running

 `ccl [file] [-d]`

Without a file name, CCL will run in interactive mode. With one, it will read a file and execute it.

The flag `-d` turns on debug mode.
